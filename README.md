# Deckidz (Gaming-Studio-platform)

Welcome to the demo version of the **Deckidz** website — a frontend project built using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. It is **not the official production version**, but rather a mockup to demonstrate layout, structure, and basic features.

🔧 **Purpose**:
- Trial development
- Frontend showcase
- Client feedback and revision

💡 I enjoyed working on this demo and exploring the design and user interface ideas. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!

> ⚠️ Note: This project is intended only for demonstration purposes and may not reflect the final functionality or content of the actual Deckidz website.
